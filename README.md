# Probabilistic-Programming-Langauges

Create AI to pass a Turing Test with Probabilistic Language


# TODO

Outline of this course can certainly be fleshed out one at a time:

- Algorithm for music generation
- Algorithm for first association emulation
- Turing Test PresentationSlides
- Speech to text (wrapper on `espeak`)
- Algorithm boilerplate description
- Hacking : )
